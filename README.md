Very minimalistic chrome extension that allow you switch between audible tabs with hotkeys.

Please note the default hotkeys are `Ctrl + Shift + 1` and `Ctrl + Shift + 2` to switch between previous and the next audible tab. 
you can change them by going to extensions settings => keyboard shortcuts.
